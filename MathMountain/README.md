## Test Your Skills
Test your skills with dynamically generated tests. These can be preset tests respective to the difficulty level of the math being taught in each grade, by topic, or cumulative tests. These tests provide feedback about test scores, correct answers and they can even be customized to the type of math you wish to practice.

## Practice Sheets
As with the tests section of the website, practice work sheets are generated dynamically, with presets based on grade, topic, or can be completely customized to your needs. These are great for practicing on paper, handing out as homework, or in class evaluations. Practice sheets can also be printed right from the website or saved through the print to PDF option.
